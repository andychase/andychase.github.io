(All interviews referenced are dated 2015-11-19 through 2015-11-24)



-   (P.1) Software packaging is inadequate



    -   Documentation isn't always there



        -   (Hutchings Q.40) \[Talking about derived data\] "can't figure
            out what's going on without documentation on how the product was
            gridded"
        -   (O'Neill Q.16) "l take somebodies stuff and sometimes times it
            takes a little bit of time-- to see how it's supposed to be
            used?"



    -   Outside code doesn't work / Isn't fully tested



        -   (O'Neill Q.15) "Yeah, occasionally, sometimes I get code from
            other people that \[laughs\] doesn't work? It's because it works on
            their stuff and not mine."
        -   (Hutchings Q.27) \[About software bugs:\] "So you know how
            endemic they are then-- they are mistakes everywhere!"



    -   Code not available in all languages



        -   (Hutchings Q.25) "It all comes down to where you find your code, so I've used
            R-- because there was code available."



    -   Outside code isn't trusted



        -   (O'Neill Q.18) "Like, I mean I have had people give me code
            that I didn't trust them so I didn't use it"



    -   Researchers are open to using software packages



        -   (Scientists via Kuuipo Q.13) \[Are scientists open to using
            packages?\] "Yes, yeah. Especially Open Source tools and libraries,"
            -- "\[For example\] students will start off by learning R then they
            will <span class="c23">quickly start using all
            the libraries that can manipulate the statistics
            geographically."
        -   (O'Neill Q.13) "Sometimes \[I look for\] utilities like
            \[ellipse routines\] And yeah I download it and try it once and if
            it works like it's supposed to like that then "that's cool"
        -   (Hutchings Q.26) "It helps to have access to people's code
            when they have solved problems" (Q.23) "I think we're now in a world
            where free sharing information and algorithms is a good thing to
            do."



-   (P.2) Work is often re-done / Wasted work



        -   Researchers write software that isn't saved or reused



            -   (Chelton, not noted) -- Feel free to re-implement the
                algorithms I listed in my paper for finding Eddies
            -   (O'Neill, Q.14) Shares only some code and only with certain
                people -- "Yeah. I share it fairly freely. I share my stuff-- at
                least the stuff I know-- I'm pretty sure it's not buggy
                \[laughing\]"



    -   Derived Products aren't trusted



        -   (Shell) A lot of work goes into derived products but many
            researchers don't use them



-   (P.3) Version control is inadequate



    -   (O'Neill Q.28) "I think I ended up having to ask the computer
        guy to get the backup because they do backups every night-- yeah
        version control would be very good."



-   (P.4) Knowledge is not shared / Researchers have to learn
    about things outside their domain



    -   (O'Neill Q.25) Had to learn how things were encoding for
        visualization "- you end up getting into the details of like how
        these things get encoded and as a researcher it's not-"
    -   (Hutchings Q.47) "Well we don't even realize that it's that
        easy to get the data haha, that's funny."
    -   (Kennedy, Q.3) "that's a lot to manage and it requires a
        certain level of expertise and interest in doing the computer
        management and all that stuff which not everyone has"
    -   (Scientists via Kuuipo Q.16) "researchers are still creating
        their own data" -- "and don't even know that other researchers exist
        or that other data exists"
    -   (O'Neill Q.17) Researchers don't always use existing formats
        -- "but sometimes people have like their own binary format or
        something"



-   (P.5) Data can be hard to work with

        

    -   Not indexed in the right way (temporally)



        -   (O'Neill, Q.4) Going through to find time series is a pain --
             "so you have to look through \[millions of files to find one point
            in each one\] and it's kind of a pain" 



    -   Data not being in the right format / poorly documented
        formats



        -   (O'Neill Q.17) "but sometimes people have like their own
            binary format or something-- or it's just put into an unformatted
            binary file"
        -   (Hutchings Q.16) --  "if the data is not provided with a way
            of reading it-- no one else can use it so-- as you said it's
            useless."



    -   Researchers have to deal with a lot of data



        -   (Kennedy) Landsat 100tb
        -   (Jamon) Landsat 100 gb (currently)-100tb (ideally)
        -   (O'Neill) Various 70 terabytes
        -   (Shell) Various 10tb



    -   Data goes away (or at least used to)



        -   (O'Neill, Q.30) "now you don't have to worry about: is it
            going to be there in two years? or something.."
        -   (Shell) You don't want to lose access right before the
            deadline
