## Story of the project

### An exciting start

For my senior capstone project at [Oregon State University][5], I was assigned to build a product for a team from NASA JPL. Since I had some project management experience (I've built [a few](https://andychase.me#projects) projects in the past), I was excited to see what kind of product we could build.

[Here's the original Project Proposal][1], in summary: 

> [Product is a] web service and client that will better enable scientists and researchers to retrieve and analyze imagery data [...]

The full proposal was kind of confusing, since I wasn't sure what exactly they wanted. After discussing the idea with them, I'm not sure what they knew exactly what they wanted either.

### Background work

It sounded like a good idea, and we started putting together some prototypes of how we thought the idea would look [1] [2]. It became clear that the NASA JPL mentors wouldn't be the ones using the tool, so I knew we would need to find someone at Oregon State that would actually use the tool to give us feedback.

### Building a prototype to narrow down idea with client

At this point I came up with the best representation of the product I could to show people what we'd be working on. The client agreed that the prototype and its associated development plan would work well.

Having all the information we needed at this point, this is probably where most engineers would have probably stopped and just began working, but I wanted something that people really needed; not just a toy.

### Finding customers

I started a list of people from the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences using the facatly listings page that seemed interested and also asked the office ladies if they had any names. I only got a few names, but after hitting some difficulty getting meeting scheduled I casted a much wider net.

I sent very short emails basically just asking for a meeting and ended up with decent response rate that landed us the interviews we needed (with about a 60% response rate).

### Interviewing Customers

I learned a few things really quickly from speaking with researchers:

* They love to talk and give their opinion on things
* Keeping notes was impossible for these long meetings. I quickly switched to audio recording and transcribing which I had learned from my anthropology. This was important for a lot of reasons
	* I could go back and make connections that I wouldn't have otherwised remembered
	* Direct quotes was more convincing to my client my general opinion 
* The researchers generally didn't seem to like talking about my prototypes
	* When generalizing the topic to see if the problem in general was one they needed solving, they gave me the information I needed
