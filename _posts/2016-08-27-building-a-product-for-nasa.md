## Story of the project

### An exciting start

For my senior capstone project at [Oregon State University][5], I was assigned to build a product for a team from NASA JPL. Since I had some project management experience (I've built [a few](https://andychase.me#projects) projects in the past), I was excited to see what kind of product we could build.

[Here's the original Project Proposal][1], in summary: 

> [Product is a] web service and client that will better enable scientists and researchers to retrieve and analyze imagery data [...]

The full proposal was kind of confusing, since I wasn't sure what exactly they wanted. After discussing the idea with them, I'm not sure what they knew exactly what they wanted either.

### Background work

It sounded like a good idea, and we started putting together some prototypes of how we thought the idea would look [1] [2]. It became clear that the NASA JPL mentors wouldn't be the ones using the tool, so I knew we would need to find someone at Oregon State that would actually use the tool to give us feedback.

### Building a prototype to narrow down idea with client

### Finding customers

I started a list of people from the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences using the facatly listings page that seemed interested and also asked the office ladies if they had any names. I only got a few names, but after hitting some difficulty getting meeting scheduled I casted a much wider net.

I sent very short emails basically just asking for a meeting and ended up with decent response rate that landed us the interviews we needed (with about a 60% response rate).
