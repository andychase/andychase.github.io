## Story of these interviews

For my senior project at [Oregon State University][5] I was assigned to work with NASA JPL to build a science tool for researchers to use. These problems are the results of interviews I performed as part of customer validation.

## Problems


(All interviews referenced are dated 2015-11-19 through 2015-11-24)


### (P.1) Software packaging is inadequate



#### Documentation isn't always there
-   [(Hutchings Q.40)][jenn#h.ldjh88h17nwr] \[Talking about derived data\] "can't figure
    out what's going on without documentation on how the product was
    gridded"
-   [(O'Neill Q.16)][oneill#14-20] "I take somebodies stuff and sometimes times it
    takes a little bit of time-- to see how it's supposed to be
    used?"


#### Outside code doesn't work / Isn't fully tested
-   [(O'Neill Q.15)][oneill#14-20] "Yeah, occasionally, sometimes I get code from
    other people that \[laughs\] doesn't work? It's because it works on
    their stuff and not mine."
-   [(Hutchings Q.27)][jenn#h.weg8wqmw21df] \[About software bugs:\] "So you know how
    endemic they are then-- they are mistakes everywhere!"



#### Code not available in all languages
-   [(Hutchings Q.25)][jenn#h.weg8wqmw21df] "It all comes down to where you find your code, so I've used
    R-- because there was code available."



#### Outside code isn't trusted
-   [(O'Neill Q.18)][oneill#14-20] "Like, I mean I have had people give me code
    that I didn't trust them so I didn't use it"



#### Researchers are open to using software packages
-   [(Scientists via Kuuipo Q.13)][kuuipo] \[Are scientists open to using
    packages?\] "Yes, yeah. Especially Open Source tools and libraries,"
    -- "\[For example\] students will start off by learning R then they
    will <span class="c23">quickly start using all
    the libraries that can manipulate the statistics
    geographically."
-   [(O'Neill Q.13)][oneill#10-13] "Sometimes \[I look for\] utilities like
    \[ellipse routines\] And yeah I download it and try it once and if
    it works like it's supposed to like that then "that's cool"
-   [(Hutchings Q.26)][jenn#h.weg8wqmw21df] "It helps to have access to people's code
    when they have solved problems" [(Q.23)][jenn#h.weg8wqmw21df] "I think we're now in a world
    where free sharing information and algorithms is a good thing to
    do."



### (P.2) Work is often re-done / Wasted work



#### Researchers write software that isn't saved or reused
-   [(Chelton, not noted)][chelton] -- Feel free to re-implement the
    algorithms I listed in my paper for finding Eddies
-   [(O'Neill, Q.14)][oneill#14-20] Shares only some code and only with certain
    people -- "Yeah. I share it fairly freely. I share my stuff-- at
    least the stuff I know-- I'm pretty sure it's not buggy
    \[laughing\]"



#### Derived Products aren't trusted
-   [(Shell)][shell] A lot of work goes into derived products but many
    researchers don't use them



### (P.3) Version control is inadequate



-   [(O'Neill Q.28)][oneill#27-28] "I think I ended up having to ask the computer
    guy to get the backup because they do backups every night-- yeah
    version control would be very good."



###  (P.4) Knowledge is not shared / Researchers have to learn about things outside their domain



-   [(O'Neill Q.25)][oneill#25-26] Had to learn how things were encoding for
    visualization "- you end up getting into the details of like how
    these things get encoded and as a researcher it's not-"
-   [(Hutchings Q.47)][jenn#46-47] "Well we don't even realize that it's that
    easy to get the data haha, that's funny."
-   [(Kennedy, Q.3)][kennedy] "that's a lot to manage and it requires a
    certain level of expertise and interest in doing the computer
    management and all that stuff which not everyone has"
-   [(Scientists via Kuuipo Q.16)][kuuipo] "researchers are still creating
    their own data" -- "and don't even know that other researchers exist
    or that other data exists"
-   [(O'Neill Q.17)][oneill#14-20] Researchers don't always use existing formats
    -- "but sometimes people have like their own binary format or
    something"



###  (P.5) Data can be hard to work with



#### Not indexed in the right way (temporally)
-   [(O'Neill, Q.4)][oneill] Going through to find time series is a pain --
     "so you have to look through \[millions of files to find one point
    in each one\] and it's kind of a pain" 



#### Data not being in the right format / poorly documented formats
-   [(O'Neill Q.17)][oneill#14-20] "but sometimes people have like their own
    binary format or something-- or it's just put into an unformatted
    binary file"
-   [(Hutchings Q.16)][jenn#13-19] --  "if the data is not provided with a way
    of reading it-- no one else can use it so-- as you said it's
    useless."



#### Researchers have to deal with a lot of data
-   [(Kennedy)][kennedy] Landsat 100tb
-   [(Jamon)][jamon] Landsat 100 gb (currently)-100tb (ideally)
-   [(O'Neill)][shell] Various 70 terabytes

<!-- -->
-   [(Shell)][shell] Various 10tb

#### Data goes away (or at least used to)
-   [(O'Neill, Q.30)][oneill#29-31] "now you don't have to worry about: is it
    going to be there in two years? or something.."
-   [(Shell)][shell] You don't want to lose access right before the
    deadline
