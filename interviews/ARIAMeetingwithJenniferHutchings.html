c1">Q.1i</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;First off I want to tell you a bit about my project so you know where I&#39;m coming from. I&#39;m working with NASA JPL to help build a project to help earth researchers and specifically we&#39;re trying to use remote sensed images to help researchers do their work</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">[</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;Who are you working with at NASA?]</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279; Well, specifically it&#39;s the GIBS team, which is like the Global Imagery Browser Service Team, and they make WorldView Maps basically, and people&#39;s names are Lewis McGibbney and Charles Thompson.</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hm, I think I&#39;m familiar with the data.. but not the people :)</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Okay, so my first question is what challenges do you think researchers face-- ice researchers face using remote sensed images in their research?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, wow, that&#39;s a big question. So the biggest challenges is a lot of the remote sensed products-- not necessarily the images but the products-- are </span><span class="c1 c6">&#65279;not</span><span class="c1">&#65279; necessarily provided with.. uncertainty...?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Uncertainty&#65279;&#65279;? You mean like bounds of error?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bounds of error and bias. and this is actually a </span><span class="c1 c6">huge</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;area of research because on some of the products we don&#39;t necessarily know what uncertainties and bias are. Thinking of particular some of the ice things/products that are out there...</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1 c7">Q.3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Like SAR? I saw you used SAR in your research.. the scatterometry?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;Yes.. I do</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;, I used-- I&#39;ve used the radarSAT geophysical-- processing system? Which [? Ron Clark] worked on-- which is looking at Ice Drift. Yeah! one of the biggest problems with that product is that it isn&#39;t fully documented. So that can be-- a huge challenges when you realize you&#39;re working with a dataset and you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s causing differences between the data you&#39;re working on and another dataset.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">So I&#39;m interested-- you said --remote sensing-- you don&#39;t the images at all in your work?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do use the images, so typically I use visual or thermal images </span><span class="c4 c1">[like modis?]</span><span class="c1">, modis yeah. Normally it&#39;s level 1b basically-- the calibrated stuff I&#39;m not interested in calibrating my own data [laughing].</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;I noticed you have a Ph.D. in remote sensing is that right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My Ph.D. advisor was doing remote sensing, I used remote sensing in my thesis, sometimes these titles get mixed up-- so the majority of my Ph.D. was in modeling.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Ok-- &#65279;I was interested in that because I noticed-- some of your latest work is deploying buoys and bots-- so you&#39;re actually collecting data on the ground </span><span class="c1">&#65279;[Yeah] </span><span class="c4 c1">not necessarily using remote sensing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, that&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I saw that--earlier work you looked at tracking ice using remote sensing-- but it wasn&#39;t reliable enough to not need buoys-- seems like you mostly used that to figure out where to put the buoys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, so what happens is with satellite overpasses you only get a snapshot of the ice path-- somewhere between every six hours in particular locations, or three days.. depending on the orbits. So I&#39;m interested in sub synoptic scale-- </span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;[What&#39;s that?] </span><span class="c1">&#65279;which is meaning &quot;below the weather scale&quot;, so you know weather synoptic time scales is the time scale a weather system exists over which can be 3 days to a week, or 2 days to a week. A lot of the work I&#39;m doing is at inertial motion of the ice-- or tidal motion of the ice pack, which is all on subdaily timescales, and so you can&#39;t actually look at that with remote sensing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it&#39;s nice to-- when you&#39;re trying to understand how ice deforms and moves you have to look at it on high time resolution as well as high spatial resolution-- so that&#39;s where we need to blend remote sensing together</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7 c1">Q.8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So how do you blend that?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So-- I don&#39;t </span><span class="c1 c6">blend</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it right now [laughing] I&#39;ll say-- That&#39;s a high level product that would be quite difficult to make.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So you mostly use [remote sensing] for visualization purposes?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;Yeah I&#39;ll use the imagery for visualization-- what the field of drift looks like-- and then overplot buoys on that and I use the buoys information for time series analysis. So yeah it&#39;s-- you end up synthesize different data sets together that are not necessarily compatible with each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">How so? The resolutions are so different?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah. And the errors on the position for remote sensing products is very different. GPS.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Because of clouds?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually for tracking ice drift what&#39;s happening is you&#39;re looking at-- feature tracking-- on the path so you do that in many different ways it&#39;s often cross-correlation analysis between two images to find those features and there&#39;s an error associated with that.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.11</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So you might be tracking the noise, not the ice</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;So you&#39;re hoping you are tracking the ice-- and they&#39;re normally quite good at doing that, but the position error associated with that can normally be quite large. Yeah, sorry, I&#39;m sending you in all different directions here. [No no, it&#39;s great.] The fundamental thing that it all comes down to is we need to know what the uncertainties are in the products to be able to use them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Cool, makes sense. [..] How small are tracking?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;So with drifting buoys-- with GPS I&#39;m limited to not being able to track below about a 1 km</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.12</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So you&#39;d like to track more but you can&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, w</span><span class="c1">ell I </span><span class="c1 c6">&#65279;could</span><span class="c1">&#65279; if I used differential GPS methods, so you can go down scale if you improve your position error-- so there&#39;s a fundamental limit on what you can actually track with remote sensing-- which is not a bad thing, we just need to know what the limit is.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should point out, you know a lot of people when they talk about their frustration with using remote sensing imagery will bring up this issue of them not providing error-- is not provided with error in some cases-- but I actually think for many of the products [error] is a high level research question to identify what those are.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re looking for recommendations for what a database should provide, this might be a tricky one.</span></p><h1 class="c0 c12" id="h.qzlu7u6jsz8t"><span>Sharing Data in Ice Research &amp; Binary Formats</span></h1><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.13</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;I&#39;m just trying to see-- in general problems researchers face, but I do think this is really helpful [..]</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">So another question I had is about the status of sharing science in research. I know I&#39;ve heard from before that in some disciplines the sharing [of] data is pretty poor-- a lot of people are repeating the same data collection-- tell me about the status of sharing in ice-- I saw that you run an Ice Watch service-- was that in response to seeing a lot of fragmented data?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;It was! Yeah- actually it wasn&#39;t my idea it came out of a workshop in 2009-- but the climb to the cryosphere sponsored, and the work </span><span class="c1 c6">&#65279;theme</span><span class="c1">&#65279; was to coordinate and standardize our measurement methods-- and it was for industry field work-- specifically. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&#39;s always a need for sharing data and-- if you&#39;re sharing data that&#39;s difficult to collect-- it helps to standardize your method for collecting that. That&#39;s in relation to this particular field data, it&#39;s not necessarily how you would treat remote sensed data.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.14</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Yeah, I noticed that that&#39;s just all on the ground data-- you don&#39;t combine it all.</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, it is and I-- at the moment we&#39;re all just working on collecting the data and then-- the next step is providing it in formats the users need.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.15</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So right now you&#39;re not providing the data for people?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s free available in .csv format! Yeah, so I&#39;m beta testing a different format that ice charting group use, called seger3--</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;[*writes it down*]</span><span class="c1">&#65279;-- yeah don&#39;t worry it&#39;s all jargon [laughs]</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;Yeah I know-- maybe this is more atmospheric and ocean-- but I know they use netcdf and hdf formats--but I guess there&#39;s a wide range. I know a researcher was talking about a couple days ago that some research groups provide data in binary formats-- and they don&#39;t say how to use them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;So the problem with binary format is unless you&#39;re given a piece of code of how to read it with the algorithm of how to read-- and you know whether it&#39;s big endian or small endian you can&#39;t use it-- I&#39;ve seen providing binary data with no additional metadata as a way of preventing people from using the data.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;It&#39;s like-- people will-- the zero order is they say providing the data-- but-- if the data is not provided with a way of reading it-- no one else can use it so-- as you said it&#39;s useless.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you are a researcher that&#39;s protective of their the data-- maybe that&#39;s what they want. There&#39;s two things that could be at work, they could be protective of their data or they might not just have enough time.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So have you run into that-- have any ships said they didn&#39;t want to provide their data?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, I&#39;ve run into oil industry ships that didn&#39;t provide their data-- but said would when they reach the embargo period which is a couple years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Is that just because that&#39;s a trade secret?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, they just don&#39;t want to share where they&#39;ve been, and that you can respect because they have an embargo period.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&#39;s more frustrating is when you&#39;re trying to use data that other people have created and they </span><span class="c1 c6">do</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;provide it to you, but you can&#39;t actually use it-- I&#39;ve run into </span><span class="c1 c6">that</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.18</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Oh really? So they provide it to you but you can&#39;t use it?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s impossible to use-- at the moment. It might just be that more communication is required in order to extract the information that needed, but it&#39;s really hard to do that-- </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve a big advocate for people providing data in &nbsp;netcdf format. The problem is is that it&#39;s expensive to get in netcdf format</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.19</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">What is that, just writing the converters?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;Well to get anything into a data format takes time, and mad hours.

The other thing that&#39;s useful for researchers is-- understandable gridding tools? So modellers like to have their data gridded, and often remote sensing data is provided in gridded format? It&#39;s really important that we understand how that gridding is done-- I&#39;m at the moment working with a dataset where I-- there&#39;s no documentation on how the gridding is done.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.38</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Just so I understand-- are you talking about-- I know satellites float over and they&#39;re not going in Latitude/Longitude-- are you talking about where they map the datasets to..?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So just mapping. So if you have a-- model that you want to-- compare directly with satellite data you need to map the satellite data into real space or if you have a field campaign</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Like for images for example, you have to map those points onto the pixels? </span><span class="c1">&#65279;[Yeah] </span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;So understanding how that&#39;s done, basically?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, I mean I&#39;ve actually some really cool IDL code that does that really slick-- so you could basically have a satellite track analyzer that plots up the data for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.39</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">From the raw data?</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, so that&#39;s kind of cool. So when it comes to gridded products which the public use all the time I find it frustrating that the documentation is not provided on how those gridded products were created. I&#39;m working at the moment the GRPS product, and it has a gridded product that&#39;s publically available and it does not look anything like my drifting buoy data. It&#39;s.. missing signal somewhere.. that&#39;s all I can say it&#39;s frightening.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.40</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Could be pushing wrong data out there..? or maybe your model just doesn&#39;t match up somehow?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going on without documentation on how the product was gridded.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.41</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">[..] So that&#39;s the end of my questions, but one thing I wanted to show you &#39;cause you mentioned Python was an idea that I came up with as a replacement that we kind of scratched, but I thought was kind of interesting, [hands over paper prototype] the idea was basically to try as hard as we can to stream acquiring datasets from NASA.</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, so you can select regions and time in the classic way.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.42</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Showing that to other researchers, what I heard was, first of all: acquiring data currently is not difficult, in fact a lot of the ways that are streamlined already they just don&#39;t use &#39;cause they can just go ftp in and download it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah that&#39;s pretty much what I do. Actually I find, anytime there&#39;s a new web interface to get ahold of data I have to spend an extra half--to a few hours learning how to go through the interface in order to get the data-- but on the other hand-- so for a researcher&#39;s perspective I&#39;ll figure out a way to get the data-- that&#39;s not the worry-- from the public perspective-- </span><span class="c1 c6">&#65279;getting/</span><span class="c1">&#65279;being able to get ahold of data in a transparent way is probably important, I would &nbsp;imagine.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.43</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I don&#39;t know how much the public deals with scientific data.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, who knows how much the public is using MODIS imagery.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, I should show you something, have you seen this? Ok, so talking about the public using NASA data, there is a website, a blog that has a wide following of people that like Sea-Ice, for whatever reason I don&#39;t know why.</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Maybe they all just want to go to Antarctica</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe they just enjoy looking at pretty pictures of ice, but what they </span><span class="c1 c6">&#65279;do</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;do is-- this blog has access to data on here-- the guy who is making it is pulling data from different websites where it&#39;s made available and presenting it here in a nice way and then people come to this blog for information about what the ice packs doing-- and this guy is not a scientist he-- I think he might be an engineer and he does this in his free time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Just interest in ice?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just interest in ice. And they [laughs]-- they&#39;re doing crowdsourced science-- they participated in something called the Sea Ice outlook were members of the blog voted on when we would see the summer minimum of sea ice and what the extend of the ice would be, at summer minimum in the arctic-- kind of wacky stuff-- but they&#39;re actually using data on this site! and they&#39;re parsing it-- and it would be hard to find-- so look they&#39;ve got satellite imagery-- they&#39;re pulling it from somewhere-- this guy has plotted up trends in ice extent in area by month-- so they&#39;re taking data from the national snow and ice data center-- </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so imagine these guys if they could search the NASA database and do anything they wanted with the data.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c7 c1">Q.44</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Yeah, I think most of the NASA data is available for public consumption-- maybe a bit hidden?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah. So they&#39;re definitely using the MODIS imagery that NASA uses, and probably AVHR as well, but I&#39;ve seen mostly MODIS-- and they also tend to parse a lot of-- data from researchers to the public.

I think there&#39;s a lot of people out there that if you give them data they&#39;ll actually look at it. Not just be passive, you know.. NASA always been providing pretty imagery to the public that everyone loves-- the whole space telescope stuff comes to mind right now because that&#39;s in the news but-- I think we underestimate how much the public would use the data too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I think in the Computer Science community, we rely </span><span class="c4 c1 c6">&#65279;vastly</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279; on just general interest and-- I mean the actual computer science academics-- they&#39;re doing things that the general public not going to use for the next 10-20 years but-- I think a lot of stuff that&#39;s pushing us forward is coming from people that don&#39;t have CS degrees or maybe just doing it for fun or are in countries where they can&#39;t easily get CS degrees so-- that&#39;s an interesting though that just making it easier for people to use could lead to more eyes looking at the data-- and more discoveries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, and that would be the polar opposite from what I need. I basically just don&#39;t want you messing with the data [laughing] I need to have the raw levels of the raw data there, and documented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><h1 class="c0 c12" id="h.f4k24biftp8y"><span>Discovering NASA Web Services Exist</span></h1><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c7 c1">Q.46</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">[..] so helping Earth researchers is a tall order, so trying to figure that out is.. hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah.. so one of the things that&#39;s kind of cool is being able to look through imagery in real time.

So the near real time site has these little thumbnails of modis imagery and you&#39;re like-- it&#39;s sitting there searching through it trying to find-- which-- and you start memorizing the orbit paths so you can remember which part of the screen I&#39;m going to find that particular location [laughing] on the planet-- that site can do with a bit of a &quot;spiff up&quot; make the data more--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Well they actually-- the team that I work with GIBS will take that imagery and put it on a &quot;Google Maps&quot; type service called </span><span class="c4 c1 c6">WorldView</span><span class="c4 c1">&#65279; and then you can see it show up as it comes out</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&#65279;</span><span class="c1">&#65279;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">O.k.!
