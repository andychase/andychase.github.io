class="c5">GIScience Program Director</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c9">GIS, metadata, marine resource management.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.1i</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know if you know anything about our project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Noo, tell me about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Uhmm, Yeah, so it&#39;s pretty exciting, we are working with NASA JPL to build software to help researchers, earth researchers specifically, do their research,</span><span class="c5">[ah]</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that&#39;s like the general overview.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;[Right] </span><span class="c1">The people we are working with are from the global imagery browser service team, so what they do is take earth data and they, uh, make pictures of it, and make it so you can like zoom in on parts of the earth and see cool Satellite pictures and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, from what I understand from their project description... which if you want you can actually read if you want [hands over project description]...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Y</span><span class="c5">eah that would actually be great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From what I understand, their goal is to allow researchers to use that images to do their research</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Right, and this is with NASA?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah NASA JPL</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">How did you get involved with them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was for our senior project, so every CS student has to do a three term capstone</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;[right] </span><span class="c1">and so Daniel is part of my team and this other kid too, and we were assigned this group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Oh so you were assigned this project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well we selected some choices and from there we were assigned </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hmm &#39;k. [Reading project description]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">So they have imagery data, and they want a web service? </span><span class="c5">[</span><span class="c1">Yes, I think so.]</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;And uhmm.. do they have services already set up and you&#39;re just creating another one...? Or&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Uhmm, yes the thing is we are very vague-- we are trying to meet with researchers to figure out what will help researchers because I don&#39;t think they know exactly what they want either, </span><span class="c5">[Oh&hellip; Okay.] </span><span class="c1">Yeah, so GIBS is a service that provides images-- that&#39;s already set up </span><span class="c5">[Yeah, right.]</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and they have like tools for seeing those images and looking through them already. </span><span class="c5">[Ok.] </span><span class="c1">Called WorldView I think, yeah WorldView. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">But do they want more researchers</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to come to that site and actually use the data?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay well from talking to them, what we understand this&hellip; [hands over prototype] here&#39;s my prototype for what we&rsquo;re thinking might be useful. Well specifically we&#39;re to try to help researchers find things </span><span class="c5">[&#39;kay.] </span><span class="c1">like visually finding things, using like shapes and things. And Lewis [our client] is really keen on &quot;images as a proxy&quot;, which we have no idea what that means, but I think what that means looking through the images instead of the data. </span><span class="c5">[Okay, yeah, I think so too.] </span><span class="c1">Yeah it&#39;s a good hypothesis. Yeah. </span><span class="c5">[Yeah, Yeah.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">F</span><span class="c5">or example, we were looking at some remote sensing images around Syria yesterday, and we&rsquo;re actually looking at areas that have been affected by drought, and the information we were learning about was agricultural data, but you could </span><span class="c3">see</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;that, you could see what vegetation was affected by the drought so much easier just looking at the remotely sensed image. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like the pictures?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Yup, just looking at the pictures you could see where the drought was and it was interesting because it followed political boundaries.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;S</span><span class="c5">o like in Turkey there were a lot of green and then at the border of Turkey and Syria you go down to Syria and it was brown, and that was telling us a lot, that somehow Turkey was getting a lot of water resources, where as soon as you got to Syria they weren&#39;t, so that&#39;s a remote sensed image that was giving us a lot of information. Just by looking at the colors of the vegetation.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So one question I have then is was that hard to find? Or did you already kind of know where you were looking for that information or were you just kind of searching all over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">I think another researcher that did this talk that would be really useful to talk to because he worked at NASA himself, and he has a lot of background information that would probably be helpful to you </span><span class="c5">[windows error sound], is</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Jamon, </span><span class="c1">[Oh I&#39;m meeting with him on [next Tuesday]] </span><span class="c5">oh, okay, perfect! Well it sounds like you guys know who to talk to. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh well I mean, just information from Ted </span><span class="c5">[Yeah.] </span><span class="c1">So he worked with you on&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">So he was giving&hellip; Yesterday was &quot;GIS day&quot; [laughs]</span><span class="c5">, kind of our Woodstock</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;[laughs]</span><span class="c5">. and so we were met on campus and we heard different presentations about what&#39;s going on, and Jamon gave the keynote presentation at the end. So he was a NASA postdoc so he will know </span><span class="c3">exactly</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;where you guys are coming from, he&#39;ll probably be familiar with the databases, because he was telling us how the imagery he had isn&#39;t publicly available, so it was given to him because he worked at NASA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Yeah, so he well, he will be perfect, he will tell you what data, so </span><span class="c3">HE</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;was given the data that he was doing his research on. </span><span class="c1">[The images?] </span><span class="c5">The remotely sensed images. </span><span class="c5">So what other researchers do, especially students, they have to go and search for it themselves, but hopefully Jamon can enlighten you about where to find-</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.5</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">GIBS provides lots of different Images types, and one gives images of resolution about 250 meters, I don&#39;t know like what resolution he&#39;s working with, but that&#39;s available almost every day they release those images.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Right, his resolution was probably better than that, I wanna to say one meter, but I&#39;m not positive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah that sounds like something they would probably not provide for everyone</span><span class="c5">. [Yeah, right.] [laughs]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">And then there&#39;s the issue that you&#39;re talking about terabytes upon terabytes. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.6</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah a lot of data, that makes sense, so going back the question, so was that hard to find those areas of vegetation? Was that something you kind of knew about coming into it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Oh so the way most research works, I would say in Geography, I couldn&#39;t speak for other disciplines, in Geography we&#39;re very interested in a particular place, so normally a geographer will have identified the place they are interested in. </span><span class="c1">[Okay]</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Geographers are very interested in space and time. So they are going to know, they are going to have a research question that starts with: &quot;In this particular place&quot;, be it a small locale or even globally on the entire earth, they will have a research question and it will definitely be attached to a place. At different scales from local, regional and global scales.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.7</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So you have never really worked on any projects where you aren&#39;t sure when or where something is located?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">The projects I have worked on have been all based in Oregon,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">so </span><span class="c5">for me no, it&#39;s Oregon and the time frame has been recent, you know modern. That&#39;s a good question though,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Geographers pretty much know the time and the place that they want to do their research, because what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re comparing-- they also do comparisons to different places, why is this place different from this place? What&#39;s causing drought and more &nbsp;in Syria and not here? They&#39;re looking at comparisons and they are also looking at comparisons as things change through time, so it&#39;s usually defined,--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">-- sometimes it&#39;s defined by the data itself, for example we have a researcher that&#39;s doing research with </span><span class="c3">National Geographic</span><span class="c5">, and she&#39;s looking at issues of </span><span class="c3">National Geographic</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;but she&#39;s looking at issues--</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;the magazines-- from the 80s until now, because she doesn&#39;t have access to issues before then. So your data can define your... </span><span class="c1">[the time you&#39;re looking for.]</span><span class="c5">[Yeah]</span><span class="c5">. And that happens a lot with students because they tend to-- they aren&#39;t working in tons of research money, like maybe their professors are, so those students may be stuck with free data. and so they might only use landsat data-- and its landsat has been a satellite that&#39;s been up during a certain time period. So they might do their research during that time period. So the data may drive the research question. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay yeah, that makes sense, yeah I was wondering about that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another thing I was curious about is the intersection-- I mean you in kind of a unique place, since you are in GIS Systems and you are not like doing the [field] research necessarily </span><span class="c5">[right.]</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but I was interested in the intersection between software and researchers </span><span class="c5">[</span><span class="c3">Good</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;question.]</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Coming into this project I assumed researchers didn&#39;t write software they just used tools available or something like that</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;[Shakes head no vigorously]</span><span class="c1">, coming into this. But after talking to Ted it, he was like &ldquo;Oh man I work with software all the time I used to write Fortran but now I have some people do it for me&quot;, and I was really interested in the fact that he said that they write their software to answer their questions, and then just throw out the software after they are done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He also said something really interesting, which was that he doesn&#39;t really trust outside software packages, but he said that was probably unique to oceanographers though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">[Laughs] And I have to admit I have been around Oceanographers and Geographers and not so much other scientists.. so in our college we have Oceanographers, Atmospheric Science, and Earth Science, so that&#39;s pretty much my exposure, but I would definitely have to agree with what Ted said; My husband worked for a Atmospheric Scientist, and he did not trust-- he would not trust-- GIS Software, my husband his first job as a student was to write programs to analyze data, that is definitely true in our college: that researchers either like to write their own code, or hire students to write the code, or work with collaborators at other institutions or other colleges to write their own code.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.9</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So is that a problem for you working with GIS systems?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">So... a lot of researchers see GIS, Geographic Information Systems, as a way to </span><span class="c3">visualize</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;their data, once they&rsquo;ve done all their analyses writing their own programs, they might use GIS to just make a map to visually display it. And they don&#39;t really see it as more than that. It&#39;s like I do all of the analysis of all my data myself, and at the very end I might throw it into a GIS for display purposes. If you talk to somebody who&#39;s a Geographic Information Scientist </span><span class="c5">they wouldn&#39;t agree with that</span><span class="c5">, they would say a great thing about a GIS is you can do all this analyses. That&#39;s what the important thing is.. but... there is definitely a difference of opinions depending on your background.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.10</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wonder what causes that, like distrust? Or maybe they just think they are smarter than the system they are using?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">That&rsquo;s a really good question.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.11</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like for us we want to get past that barrier, to produce a software that will help researchers, how are they going to find it? Or whether if they are going to find it useful. </span><span class="c5">[Right] </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">I think researchers aren&#39;t comfortable, with, let&#39;s say your GIS truncates the data at a certain-- so its numbers-- decimal points, at a certain point, the GIS is truncating your data and its a different precision than you thought it was. I mean, they would not be happy with that.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">So maybe GIS is just a &quot;black box&quot; so they don&#39;t know exactly what is happening to their data at every point of the analysis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That makes sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">You don&#39;t want rounding error, and the GIS may not be as accurate as you want your output to be. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.12</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah we were looking at a research project that was waste water being pumped into the ocean, and the researcher was able to get a resolution that we weren&#39;t able to get, and I think that part of that was the rounding processes was getting images out of the raw data itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Yep, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">And I think some researchers just like to stay with the raw data, they just don&#39;t want that data manipulated </span><span class="c3">at all</span><span class="c5">. They are going to be the ones that manipulate the data, not a piece of software.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.13</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So what do you think about researchers using software libraries or pre-prepared packages in their work? Do you think that&#39;s something that&#39;s common?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Yes, yeah. Especially Open Source tools and libraries, R is very popular right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">So R is really is in all the different libraries you can get, so R is statistics, but then there are all these libraries you can be used for Geographics statistics and </span><span class="c5">so</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;many of our students will start off by learning R then they will </span><span class="c3">quickly</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;start using all the libraries that can manipulate the statistics geographically.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.14</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do you know much about researchers acquiring data? Do you think that&#39;s something that is challenging or do you think-- I know Ted said something that might be helpful that I think might already exists might be integrating some of the data we have with GIS Systems because that would help researchers acquire it easier, although I saw NASA has a few packages already for that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Is that something you have worked with before? Researchers trying to get information easier?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">That&#39;s a very good question&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This might be a question that is better for the researchers that are working with it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Right, yeah from a GIS perspective, over the years we have created these things called, uhmm, I&rsquo;ll show you, there&#39;s a whole chapter on it in in a textbook, and I can just refer it,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">the chapter on&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">So. From the GIS perspective we have worked very hard to share our data, because that&#39;s actually very expensive, to create data and to create GIS data, I mean, there are researchers here that have driven on every single road in Oregon, and every single forestry road in Oregon, gathering data. And have canoed and kayaked down every river in Oregon or in the Willamette Valley gathering this data, it&#39;s really really expensive, really really time consuming. So in the GIS field we definitely want to share our data with each other. So we have these things called &quot;Clearinghouses&quot; where we share all these different datasets with each other, and we&#39;ve worked long and hard to make it make it easy for other people to find that data. So that is a whole field of study in Geographic Information Science.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.15</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah I saw you worked with Oregon spatial data. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Right, right, and... but how successful that really has been- the jury is still out I think on how successful it&#39;s been, they had a spatial data infrastructure that was created, like the... national... [typing]&hellip;There it is, and it is a federal effort, and then on a Federal level for the United States we have the &quot;National Spatial Infrastructure&quot;, and we have all this data and services and metadata exactly to help people find the data they need. How successful this has been, we have had the best of intentions, but I don&#39;t know how successful it&#39;s been. We also have a global data infrastructure and that might, in my textbook they&rsquo;re saying that might be a little bit more successful for people to share data globally with each other.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.16</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So why are you saying you&#39;re not sure whether it was successful? Why do you think researchers aren&#39;t being able to find or use- </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Because researchers are still creating their own data,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">and there are still silos and groups that are creating their data from scratch and don&#39;t even know that other researchers exist or that other data exists. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4">Q.17</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&#39;s really interesting, this has been really helpful and really insightful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Yeah, Yep, Sure, let me show you the chapter real quick, so this book is written by the people in the field that are kind the most knowledgeable about... GIS in general. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&#39;s the book called?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Its: </span><span class="c3">Geographic Information Science and Systems</span><span class="c5">, by Paul Longley. And there&rsquo;s a little chapter, or little section in here, &ldquo;Spatial Data Infrastructure: the US experience.&rdquo; And it tells about how we really intended to be able share our data with other researchers and hasn&#39;t really worked.
