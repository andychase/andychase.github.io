<h3 id="dear-department-of-justice">Dear Department of Justice,</h3>
<p>I am writing to report a possible Antitrust violation in Apple Inc.'s behavior towards mobile payment solution providers operating in Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I am not affiliated with Apple, Inc. or any of the affected companies. I am simply a Bitcoin enthusiast.</p>
<h3 id="potentially-offending-company">Potentially offending company</h3>
<p>Apple Inc.<br />[address removed]</p>
<h3 id="companies-affected">Companies affected</h3>
<p>These companies had Applications that were removed from the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>Blockchain Limited<br />[address removed]</p>
<p>Coinbase, Inc.<br />[address removed]</p>
<p>Gliph (gli.ph)<br />[address removed]</p>
<p>CoinJar Pty Ltd<br />[address removed]</p>
<h3 id="consumers-affected">Consumers affected</h3>
<p>Consumers using Apple's products running iOS who wish to use Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community is relatively small, but growing: The Bitcoin networked peaked at over 100,000 transactions in a single day in December '13 <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions" title="Bitcoin: Number of transactions per day">1</a>. The Blockchain Bitcoin mobile payment app had 120,000 downloads before it was removed from the iOS App Store <a href="http://blog.blockchain.info/2014/02/06/blockchain-response-to-apple/" title="Blockchain&#39;s Response to Apple removing its software from the iOS App Store">2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="details-of-the-complaint">Details of the complaint</h3>
<p>In 2008 a technology emerged that allows consumers to perform transactions through the internet using a virtual currency called &quot;Bitcoin&quot;. This currency is accepted at 2960 places worldwide <a href="http://coinmap.org/" title="A map of places that accept Bitcoin (community-maintained)">3</a>.</p>
<p>Consumers can connect a bank account through a service such as Coinbase and purchase the currency to be used in transactions or transferred from one person to another. The most common way for consumers to spend the currency in person today is through a mobile application on an Android or iOS device.</p>
<p>Apple is removing these applications from its software marketplace (the iOS App Store), hinting at its own upcoming mobile payment solution <a href="http://business.time.com/2014/01/30/apples-next-big-thing-could-be-allowing-you-to-easily-pay-for-stuff/" title="Apple’s Next Big Thing Could Be Allowing You to Easily Pay for Stuff">5</a>.</p>
<h3 id="antitrust-claim">Antitrust claim</h3>
<p>Apple is removing applications from its software marketplace to give itself the competitive advantage in in-app-purchases (from which it takes a cut) and to clear the way for its upcoming mobile payment solution.</p>
<p>&quot;An unlawful monopoly exists when one firm controls the market for a product or service, and it has obtained that market power, not because its product or service is superior to others, but by suppressing competition with anticompetitive conduct.&quot; -- DoJ summary of the The Sherman Antitrust Act <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/about/antitrust-laws.html" title="Antitrust laws and you">13</a>.</p>
<p>I claim that Apple is suppressing competition by removing competing software services from its software marketplace.</p>
<h3 id="self-regulation-and-complications">Self-Regulation and Complications</h3>
<p>Apple has not officially announced an upcoming mobile payment solution (a competing product or service).</p>
<p>In some cases, the Bitcoin App was removed because they violated Apple's software marketplace terms of use, which clearly states that &quot;Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws&quot; <a href="http://images.worldofapple.com/appstoreguidelines_9910.pdf" title="App Store Review Guidelines (Not an official copy-- may be outdated-- official copy not available to the public)">7</a>.</p>
<p>Some countries do not allow the buying or selling of Bitcoin due to various concerns <a href="http://bitlegal.net/" title="Map of countries displaying Bitcoin legality">8</a>. Bitcoin is legal in more than 40 countries including the United States.</p>
<p>Some of the removed applications did not violate any laws in the countries they were offered in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Further demonstrating the arbitrary basis of this decision, Apple’s official communication says that the app was removed because of an “unresolved issue”, a claim that cannot even be disputed and boils down to “because we said so”. There was no communication prior to removal of this popular app, no indication of any problems and no opportunity to redress any issues, making a mockery of the claim that there was an “unresolved issue”.</p>

<p>Apple has not officially stated that the removal of the Application have anything to do with its unannounced upcoming mobile payment solution.</p>
<p>Apple specifically disallows in-app-purchases to purchase physical goods (note that some apps do not enable consumers to purchase Bitcoin currency and were still removed): &quot;Apps using IAP to purchase physical goods or goods and services used outside of the application will be rejected&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/20100302_iphone_dev_agr.pdf" title="iPhone Developer Program License Agreement (2009) (Not an official copy-- may be outdated-- official copy not available to the public)">9</a>.</p>
<p>It must be stated that Apple has reserved the right to remove content as it wishes: &quot;Apple reserves the right to withdraw its approval of content previously approved, and You agree to stop making such content available for use within Your Application.&quot; -- iPhone Developer Program License Agreement (2009) <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/20100302_iphone_dev_agr.pdf" title="iPhone Developer Program License Agreement (2009) (Not an official copy-- may be outdated-- official copy not available to the public)">9</a>.</p>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>(2012)
Blockchain Limited created a mobile application to allow consumers to spend the currency on iOS devices <a href="http://blog.blockchain.info/2014/02/06/blockchain-response-to-apple/" title="Blockchain&#39;s Response to Apple removing its software from the iOS App Store(™)">2</a>.</p>
<p>(Oct 2013) Coinbase, Inc creates a application Bitcoin application which allows consumers to view their account balance and view recent transactions <a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/64824441934/the-coinbase-ios-app-has-launched" title="The Coinbase iOS app has launched!">4</a>.</p>
<p>(Oct 2013) Coinjar app is approved for the app store.</p>
<p>(Nov 2013) Apple removes the Coinbase app from the app store <a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/64824441934/the-coinbase-ios-app-has-launched" title="The Coinbase iOS app has launched!">4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These companies have spent vast resources in creating software to enable consumers to use the Bitcoin network to transfer money quickly and securely using their mobile devices.</p>
<p>While Apple may have legitimate claims against the use of these applications in countries where Bitcoin use is prohibited, the companies should be provided with the ability to alter and re-submit their applications to operate within the terms and conditions provided by Apple and international law.</p>
<p>Apple should not be allowed to have a competitive advantage in the mobile payment marketplace because they provide the platform. It is only fair for Apple to compete in the marketplace alongside these companies and allow Bitcoin applications in their software marketplace.</p>
